    description: "The snatch grip barbell shrug is a variation of the barbell shrug and an exercise used to isolate the traps.  The main difference in a snatch grip barbell shrug is the hand placement used. By utilizing the wider than shoulder width hand placement, youâ€™ll create slight more tension on the muscles of the traps.",
