About scheduling
-we can remove calendar and scheduling for simplicity sake
-instead, for simplicity, a workout will only proceed to the next split/cycle if:
    + it is the next day/days
    + if workout split is not finished yet
unless these two are fulfilled, the current workout and split will not change
-However, the user can choose which split/cycle to use in the workout anytime, 
    the behavior above is the default behavior.
-In this basic scheduling, if the user changes what workout to use:
    -the state(the current cycle and split) of the current workout will be saved
    -the state of the chosen workout will be fetched

- This can be much simpler than the calendar, because we dont have to worry abouy having a calendar component for now
- I can focus more on the progress tracking aspect of the app which is much more important

things to do:
- default behavior of scheduling as speficified here (Finished but not tested)
- edit workout function (done, not tested)
- until failure case
- add action indicators/action alerts (please)
- if workout is already finished that day, even if the user picks another split then comes back,
button should be disabled(Optional)
- saving current do workout page state and create from scratch page()
- Exercise List Page
- Loading Screen
